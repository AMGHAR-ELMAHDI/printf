# Printf-ALX
The printf function in C is used to print formatted output to the console or a file. The function takes a string as its first argument, which contains a mix of plain text and format specifiers. The format specifiers begin with a percent sign (%) and are followed by a letter that indicates the type of value that should be printed.

For example, the format specifier %d is used to print an integer, %c is used to print a character, %s is used to print a string, and so on. The printf function can also be used to print special characters such as newlines (\n) and tabs (\t).

The printf function is a core part of the C standard library and is included in the stdio.h header file. It is widely used in C programs for debugging, logging, and user interaction.
